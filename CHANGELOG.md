# Changelog

All notable changes to CallVault are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project uses semantic-ish versioning.

## [1.1.1] — unreleased

A stability + features release built on top of v1.1.0. It keeps v1.1.0's proven on-demand
Wireless-Debugging behaviour (the daemon "keep-alive" experiment that made Wireless Debugging
repeatedly turn itself on was **not** included) and adds the safe fixes plus new settings.

### Added
- **Retention / auto-delete.** Automatically delete recordings older than a chosen period
  (Daily / Weekly / Bi-weekly / Monthly, or Keep forever). Set **one period for both device & cloud,
  or a separate period for each**. A daily background sweep runs at a **time you choose**, anchored to
  the **device's local time zone** (re-anchored automatically when you change time zone). Defaults to
  off; enabling it asks for confirmation.

### Changed
- **Settings reorganised.** "Recording & storage" is now **two separate sections** — **Recording**
  (filename template, auto-record rules) and **Storage** (target, device folder, Drive folder).
- **Accordion settings.** Sections open **one at a time** (Recording open by default); opening one
  collapses the others.

### Fixed
- **Phantom Drive recordings** no longer appear in the Home list — the list is now backed by a
  standalone on-device catalog instead of Drive's stale index.
- **Folder pickers** now open at their own currently-selected folder (best-effort; OEM file pickers
  may still ignore the hint).
- **Onboarding no longer skips the ADB step** after a reinstall (Auto Backup disabled), plus clearer
  guidance for the OEM per-app battery mode (e.g. OxygenOS "Allow background activity").
- **Stuck microphone** fixed: recording start is aborted if the call ends during daemon cold-start.

### Performance
- Faster scrcpy socket connect (tighter polling).

### Security / internal
- Removed the exported debug-only broadcast receivers used during development.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-11

Complete visual redesign ("Signal" theme) plus UX polish: setup wizard, Home screen with in-app
playback and filters, smoother Wireless-Debugging pairing. See the
[v1.1.0 release](https://github.com/madkongo/CallVault/releases/tag/v1.1.0).
